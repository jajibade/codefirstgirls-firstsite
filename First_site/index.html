<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p> I enjoy doing hair and makeup in my spare time, also i have worked in an afro caribbean hair salon since the age of five, i enjoy braiding hair the most. I have gained a lot of experience working with my mother in a salon, it taught me how to engage and draw in customers. I enjoy doing makeup on myself and trying out different eye shadow colours especially when im going out for dinner with a friend or to a wedding </p>
